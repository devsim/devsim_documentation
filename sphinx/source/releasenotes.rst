Release 1.4.4 (December 1, 2019)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

An intermittent crash on |mswindowsten| was occuring at the end of the program.  It is now fixed.

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A file named ``CHANGES.md`` is now distributed with |devsim|, detailing changes to the program.

Internal changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Regression system script refactored to Python
- Refactored threading code using |cpluspluseleven| function
- Refactored timing functions for verbose mode using |cpluspluseleven| functions
- Refactored FPE detection code to |cpluspluseleven| standard


Release 1.4.3 (Novermber 16, 2019)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fix failures with the following commands:

- :meth:`devsim.delete_edge_model`
- :meth:`devsim.delete_element_model`
- :meth:`devsim.delete_interface_model`
- :meth:`devsim.delete_node_model`

Release 1.4.2 (September 12, 2019)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this release there are the following improvements.

* Errors due to floating point exceptions and failed matrix factorization are not fatal.
* The |macosx| release fixes runtime issues with |macosxhighsierra|.
* The provided binary releases utilize more libraries from |anaconda|.

Release 1.4.1 (July 7, 2019)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Math Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``cosh``, ``sinh``, ``tanh``, are now available math functions.  Please see :numref:`symdiff__functions`.  In addition, all of the functions in the table, except for Fermi and inverse Fermi functions, are evaluate in extended precision mode.  This mode may be enabled using the parameters discussed in :ref:`release_extended`.

Element Model Memory Leak
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A large memory leak was occurring during the evaluation of element edge models created with :meth:`devsim.element_from_edge_model`.  It is now fixed and memory usage is now stable when these models are evaluated.

|pythonthree| API Memory Leak
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A small memory leak could occur when :py:mod:`devsim` functions where called, or when data was returned.  These reference counting issues are now fixed.



Release 1.4.0 (May 27, 2019)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :meth:`devsim.custom_equation` and :meth:`devsim.register_function` commands take |python| functions, instead of the a string with the function name.

The following commands are available to store data on edges and element edges:

- :meth:`devsim.edge_solution`
- :meth:`devsim.set_edge_values`
- :meth:`devsim.element_solution`
- :meth:`devsim.set_element_values`
 

Release 1.3.0 (May 18, 2019)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|pythonthree| Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All of the |tcl| regression tests in the ``testing`` directory have been converted to |pythonthree|.  These tests serve as examples for features that were previously only tested using |tcl| scripting.

|tcl| Support Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|tcl| support is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of the software.

Binary Releases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scripting Languages
"""""""""""""""""""

|pythonthree| is now the only scripting language in the releases available from:

|devsimgithubrelease|

Math Library
""""""""""""

The |mswindows| version now uses |intelmklpardiso| for direct matrix factorization.  Both |linux| and |macosx| have been using |intelmklpardiso| since :ref:`release_11012015`.  Binary releases for all operating systems use BLAS/LAPACK routines from |intelmkl|.


Release 1.2.0 (May 8, 2019)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|devsim| releases have better support for |pythonthree|.  Using the stable ABI, the software is able to run newer |pythonthree| releases, without rebuilding the software.

Support for |pythontwoseven| has been removed.

The banner has been removed when the |devsim| module is imported.

The ``symdiff`` python module is now part of the |devsim| release.  This module has additional features not available using the :meth:`devsim.symdiff` command from |devsim|.  By first setting the ``PYTHONPATH`` variable to the ``lib`` directory in the |devsim| distribution, ``symdiff`` is loaded by using

.. code-block:: python

  import symdiff

Documentation is available in the ``doc`` directory of this distribution.  Examples are available in the ``examples/symdiff`` directory.

Release 1.1.0 (April 30, 2019)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Bernoulli function, :math:`B(x)`,

.. math::

  B \left( x \right) = \frac{x}{\mathrm{e}^x - 1}

and its derivative,

.. math::
  dBdx \left( x \right) = \frac{\mathrm{e}^x - 1 - x \mathrm{e}^x}{\left(\mathrm{e}^x - 1\right)^2}

have been refactored.  They are used to calculate electron and hole current densities using the Scharfetter-Gummel method :cite:`sgieeeted1969`.

The Bernoulli function has numerical issues when :math:`x` approaches ``0`` and requires special evaluation.  In this release, |devsim|, takes advantage of |cpluspluseleven| math library functions for evaluating the denominator.

In addition, these functions are evaluated with extended precision, when this mode is enabled in the simulator.  This mode is described in :ref:`release_extended` and controlling parameters are in :ref:`parameters__behavior`.

Users should expect that simulation results should change in the number of solver iterations and small differences in simulation results.  This and other functions are listed in :ref:`symdiff__functions`.

Release 1.0.0 (December 18, 2018)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The formatting of the PDF and online documentation has been improved.  Also significant changes have been made to the way |devsim| is called from |python|.

Version
^^^^^^^

Due to the numerous changes in the |python| API, the version number has been updated to having a major revision of ``1``.  We adopt the semantic version numbering presented at https://semver.org.  The version number can be accessed through the |python| interface using the ``devsim.__version__`` variable.

Operating Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |mswindows| 32-bit operating system is now supported in addition to the platforms listed in :ref:`sec__supportedplatforms`.

Python Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|devsim| is now loaded as a shared library from any compatible Python interpreter.  Previously, |devsim| binaries contained an embedded Python interpreter.  The following versions of Python are supported in this release

- 2.7
- 3.6
- 3.7 

By first setting the ``PYTHONPATH`` variable to the ``lib`` directory in the |devsim| distribution, ``devsim`` is loaded by using

.. code-block:: python

  import devsim

from |python|.  Previous releases of devsim used the ``ds`` module, the manual will be updated to reflect the change in module name.

Many of the examples in the distribution rely on the ``python_packages`` module, which is available by using:

.. code-block:: python

  import devsim.python_packages

The default version of |python| for use in scripts is |pythonthreeseven|. Scripts written for earlier versions of |pythonthree| should work.  |pythontwoseven| is deprecated for future development.


|anaconda| |pythonthreeseven| is the recommended distribution and is available from https://continuum.io.  The |intelmkl| is required for the official |devsim| releases.  These may be installed in |anaconda| using the following command:

.. code-block:: none

  conda install mkl

On the |mswindows| platform, the following packages should also be installed:

.. code-block:: none

  conda install sqlite zlib

Some of the examples and tests also use ``numpy``, which is available using:

.. code-block:: none

  conda install numpy

Please see :ref:`ch__scripting` and :ref:`sec__installation` for more information.

GMSH Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^

|gmsh| has announced a new version of their mesh format ``4.0``.  |devsim| currently supports the previous version, ``2.2``.  To load a file from |gmsh|, it is now necessary to either:

* Save the file in the ``2.2`` format from |gmsh|
* Parse the ``4.0`` file, and then use :ref:`sec__customMeshLoad`

A future release of |devsim| will provide this capability.

CGNS Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for loading |cgns| files is deprecated, and is no longer part of the official releases.  Please see :ref:`sec__externalmesher` for more information about importing meshes from other tools.

July 20, 2018
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The documentation has a new license, which is described in :ref:`sec__copyright`.  The source files are now available for download from: https://github.com/devsim/devsim_documentation.

Python 3 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python 3 executable, ``devsim_py3`` is now supplied in addition to standard Python 2 executable, ``devsim``.

Element Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :meth:`devsim.get_element_node_list` retrieves a list of nodes for every element on a ``region``, ``contact``, or ``interface``.

Interface Boundary Condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``type=hybrid`` option is now available for the :meth:`devsim.interface_equation` command.  Please see :ref:`sec__interface_equation_assembly` for information about boundary conditions.

Interace Equation Coupling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``name0``, and ``name1`` options are now available for the :meth:`devsim.interface_equation` command.  They make it possible to couple dissimilar equation names across regions.

Interface and Contact Surface Area
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contact surface area is no longer included in ``SurfaceArea`` node model.  It is now placed in ``ContactSurfaceArea``.  These are listed in :numref:`models__node`.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- The :meth:`devsim.interface_equation` command is fixed for ``type=fluxterm`` boundary conditions on the interface.
- The :meth:`devsim.get_material`, and :meth:`devsim.set_material` handle the ``contact`` option.
- Interface equation assembly skips nodes when an interface node is shared with a contact.

.. _release_extended:

Extended Precision
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following new parameters are available:

- ``extended_solver``, extended precision matrix for Newton and linear solver
- ``extended_model``, extended precision model evaluation
- ``extended_equation``, extended precision equation assembly

When compiled with 128-bit extended precision support, these options enable calculations to be performed with higher precision.  Default geometric models, are also calculated with extended precision.

.. code-block:: python

  devsim.set_parameter(name = "extended_solver", value=True)
  devsim.set_parameter(name = "extended_model", value=True)
  devsim.set_parameter(name = "extended_equation", value=True)

Currently, the |linux| and gcc-based |macosx| versions have extended precision support.

Platform Improvements and Binary Availability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many improvements have been made in the way binaries are generated for the |linux|, |macosx|, and |mswindows| platforms.

For |linux| (see ``linux.txt``):

- Create |centosfive|, (|rhelfive| compatible) build
- Build uses |intelmkl| math libraries (community edition)
- Build uses any compatible |pythontwoseven|, including |anaconda|
- Build compatible with newer |linux| distributions.

For |macosx|  (see ``macos.txt``):

- Uses the system |pythontwoseven| on |macosxyosemite|
- Provide instructions to use |anaconda| |python|

For |mswindows| (see ``windows.txt``):

- Uses any compatible |pythontwoseven|, including |anaconda|
- Build uses |intelmklce|

Binary releases are available for these platforms at |devsimorg|.

September 6, 2015
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :meth:`devsim.set_node_values` takes a new option, ``values``.  It is a list containing values to set for all of the nodes in a region.

The following new commands have been added:

- :meth:`devsim.get_equation_list`
- :meth:`devsim.get_contact_equation_list`
- :meth:`devsim.get_interface_equation_list`
- :meth:`devsim.delete_equation`
- :meth:`devsim.delete_contact_equation`
- :meth:`devsim.delete_interface_equation`
- :meth:`devsim.get_equation_command`
- :meth:`devsim.get_contact_equation_command`
- :meth:`devsim.get_interface_equation_command`

August 10, 2015
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :meth:`devsim.create_contact_from_interface` may be used to create a contact at the location of an interface.  This is useful when contact boundary conditions are needed for a region connected to the interface.

July 16, 2015
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :meth:`devsim.set_node_value` was not properly setting the value.  This issue is now resolved.

June 7, 2015
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :meth:`devsim.equation` now suppports the ``edge_volume_model``.  This makes it possible to integrate edge quantities properly so that it is integrated with respect to the volume on nodes of the edge.  To set the node volumes for integration, it is necessary to define a model for the node volumes on both nodes of the edge.  For example:

.. code-block:: python

  devsim.edge_model(device="device", region="region", name="EdgeNodeVolume",
    equation="0.5*EdgeCouple*EdgeLength")
  set_parameter(name="edge_node0_volume_model", value="EdgeNodeVolume")
  set_parameter(name="edge_node1_volume_model", value="EdgeNodeVolume")

For the cylindrical coordinate system in 2D, please see :ref:`sec__cylindrical`.

|macosxyosemite| is now supported.  Regression results in the source distribution are for a 2014 Macbook Pro i7 running this operating system.

October 4, 2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Platform Availability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The software is now supported on the |mswindows|.  Please see :ref:`sec__supportedplatforms` for more information.

- |macosxyosemite|
- |rhelsix|
- |ubuntuprecise|

Please see :ref:`sec__installation` for more information.

Platforms
^^^^^^^^^

|macosxyosemite| is now supported.  Support for 32 bit is no longer supported on this platform, since the operating system is only released as 64 bit.

Regression data will no longer be maintained in the source code repository for 32 bit versions of |ubuntuprecise| and |rhelsix|.  Building and running on these platforms will still be supported.

Source code improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The source code has been improved to compile on |macosxyosemite| and to comply with |cpluspluseleven| language standards.  Some of the structure of the project has been reorganized.  These changes to the infrastructure will help to keep the program maintainable and useable into the future.

September 8, 2013
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Convergence
